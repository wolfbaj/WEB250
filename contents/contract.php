<p>
	I, <a href="index.php?page=introduction" class="clickable">Alston J. Brackett</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my spring 2024 semester,
	WEB250 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
</p>
<p>
	I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
	and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
</p>
<p>
	I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
	not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
</p>
<p>
	I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples
	online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
	and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries)
	and never from my classmates.
</p>
